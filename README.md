# Welcome to the 42-get_next_line project

This project is an introduction to reading from file descriptors.

## Usage

```bash
cc -c get_next_line_utils.c
cc get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.o -o get_next_line
```

This project was a great exercise on not only file descriptors, but also memory management and, in my case, it was the first time I actually used linked lists to solve a problem. For detailed information take a look at the [subject](en.subject.pdf)
